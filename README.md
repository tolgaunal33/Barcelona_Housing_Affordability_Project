# 🏠 Barcelona Housing Affordability & Short-Term Rentals Impact Analysis

## 🌆 Why This Project Matters
Barcelona’s cobblestone streets and Gaudí architecture draw millions of visitors each year — but for locals, the city’s beauty hides a growing crisis.  

**Rents have surged. Incomes haven’t kept pace.** And short-term rentals like Airbnb have become a lightning rod in the debate over who gets to live in the city center.  

In recent years, entire apartment blocks have shifted from long-term homes to tourist accommodations. Neighborhoods once known for tight-knit communities now see suitcase wheels rolling by at dawn.  

This project asks a simple but urgent question:  

> **Are short-term rentals making it harder for Barcelonans to afford to live in their own city?**  

Through data from **InsideAirbnb** and official Barcelona statistics, this project explores the link between **STR saturation**, **rent pressures**, and **neighborhood vulnerability** — uncovering where affordability is eroding fastest.  

---

## 📌 Overview
This project investigates **how short-term rentals (STRs) impact housing affordability in Barcelona**, focusing on the interplay between **Airbnb activity**, **rent prices**, **income trends**, and **neighborhood vulnerability**.  

The analysis combines **open datasets** from InsideAirbnb, the Ajuntament de Barcelona, and other official sources to explore whether STR concentration correlates with rising rents and declining affordability.  

It was developed as a **final portfolio project** for a Data Analytics Bootcamp, with an emphasis on **real-world policy relevance** and **data storytelling**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Quantify STR growth** over time and its geographic distribution.  
- **Compare Airbnb presence to official HUT (tourist license) data** to assess compliance.  
- **Analyze neighborhood-level rent trends** and their relationship to STR density.  
- **Track changes in housing stock, occupancy, and tenure** over the past two decades.  
- **Identify vulnerable neighborhoods** (low income, high unemployment) and evaluate whether they are disproportionately affected.  
- **Measure affordability trends** by comparing rent growth with income growth.  
- **Produce a final “Risk Zone” classification** highlighting areas most at risk of affordability loss due to STR saturation.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Neighborhoods with high STR saturation (e.g., El Raval) tend to have higher rents and lower licensing compliance

- The rent-to-income ratio has deteriorated steadily from 2015–2021, with a sharper drop after the pandemic

- Vulnerable neighborhoods face compounded pressure: economic precarity + STR-driven rent inflation
