# ðŸŽ¯ Chapter: Connecting STR to Rent Pressures
 -- Main question:
   -- Do areas with more STRs â€” or faster STR growth â€” also experience higher or faster-growing rents?
   
SELECT * FROM rent_prices;

# âœ… Step 1A: Join Tourist Housing + Rent Data (City-Level)
SELECT

JOIN 
    rent_prices AS rp

    rp.territory_type = 'Municipality'
GROUP BY

# âœ… Step 2: STR Density vs Rent Level (Neighborhood, 2025)
 -- Weâ€™ll now explore:
  -- Are neighborhoods with higher STR density also more expensive to rent in?
